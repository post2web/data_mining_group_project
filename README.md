# data_mining_group_project
SMU data mining group project


## Workflow proposal	
- clone the repo if you havent than download all data files from kaggle and put them in inputs dir
- copy template notebook to a filename with your name as: ivelin.ipynb. Keep all notebooks in notebooks dir
- pull changes before you start working
- steal everything you like from other people's notebooks, put it in yours, add stuff, and modify stuff
- push changes as soon as you have something done
